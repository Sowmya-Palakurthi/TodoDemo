# TodoDemo

Hereâ€™s a more concise, two-paragraph description for your README file:

The Todo List Application is a backend service built using Kotlin, Ktor, PostgreSQL, and Redis for managing user tasks. It allows users to create, update, retrieve, and delete tasks, while ensuring that data is efficiently stored and cached. Redis is used to cache frequently accessed user and task data, improving performance, while PostgreSQL provides persistent storage for tasks and user information. This project demonstrates modern backend architecture with clear separation of concerns, easy-to-use endpoints for task management, and integrated caching to reduce database load.

The application provides a set of RESTful endpoints to manage users and tasks, with features such as setting and updating task statuses, handling deadlines, and removing tasks.
